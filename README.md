# Plant Tracker Flask app

This is a Flask web app that I made to help track the various watering schedules for my many
house plants. One Python script sets up the Flask server and details the various app routes.
The other Python script checks how many days it's been since each plant was watered, and
sends me an email (from myself) detailing which plants require attention, if any.
